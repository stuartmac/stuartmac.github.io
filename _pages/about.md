## About Me

I'm a Bioinformatics Scientist at the [University of Dundee](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/). My work revolves around exploring protein sequences, structures, and human genetic variation, with the goal of developing new technologies to improve human health. I also manage the [Dundee Bioinformatics Resource](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/drsasp.html), ensuring it remains accessible and up-to-date for scientists worldwide.

## My Research

My research focuses on understanding the relationship between genetic variation and protein function. At the School of Life Sciences, I've collaborated with scientists and clinicians to uncover genetic variants linked to rare skin disorders, atopic dermatitis, and COVID-19. I also investigate how [population-level variation in genes corresponds with evolutionary changes in protein structures](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06117-5).

Recent projects include studying ligand binding sites, protein-protein interactions, and [the impact of ACE2 gene variants on COVID-19](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009922).

Through the Dundee Resource, I aim to provide researchers with a comprehensive toolkit for protein sequence and structural analysis. I'm actively working to enhance our capabilities by incorporating the latest tools and algorithms in protein science, human genetics, and beyond.
