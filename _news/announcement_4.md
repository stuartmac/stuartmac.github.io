I am excited to announce that our new paper titled "<a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01708-24'>ResMAP-a saturation mutagenesis platform enabling parallel profiling of target-specific resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium</a>" has been published in MBio. This work was a collaborative effort with researchers from the Wellcome Center for Anti-infectives Research, University of Dundee, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The paper discusses the development of the RESistance Mapping And Profiling (ResMAP) platform for identifying resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium drug targets.
