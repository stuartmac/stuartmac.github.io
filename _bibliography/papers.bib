                 ultimate eradication of malaria. The efficacy of front-line
                 therapies is now threatened by emerging drug resistance; thus,
                 new tools to support the development of drugs with a lower
                 propensity for resistance are needed. Here, we describe the
                 development of a RESistance Mapping And Profiling (ResMAP)
                 platform for the identification of resistance-conferring
                 mutations in Plasmodium drug targets. Proof-of-concept studies
                 focused on interrogating the antimalarial drug target,
                 Plasmodium falciparum lysyl tRNA synthetase (PfKRS). Saturation
                 mutagenesis was used to construct a plasmid library encoding
                 all conceivable mutations within a 20-residue span at the base
                 of the PfKRS ATP-binding pocket. The superior transfection
                 efficiency of Plasmodium knowlesi was exploited to generate a
                 high coverage parasite library expressing PfKRS bearing all
                 possible amino acid changes within this region of the enzyme.
                 The selection of the library with PfKRS inhibitors, cladosporin
                 and DDD01510706, successfully identified multiple
                 resistance-conferring substitutions. Genetic validation of a
                 subset of these mutations confirmed their direct role in
                 resistance, with computational modeling used to dissect the
                 structural basis of resistance. The application of ResMAP to
                 inform the development of resistance-resilient antimalarials of
                 the future is discussed. IMPORTANCE: An increase in treatment
                 failures for malaria highlights an urgent need for new tools to
                 understand and minimize the spread of drug resistance. We
                 describe the development of a RESistance Mapping And Profiling
                 (ResMAP) platform for the identification of
                 resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium spp, the
                 causative agent of malaria. Saturation mutagenesis was used to
                 generate a mutation library containing all conceivable
                 mutations for a region of the antimalarial-binding site of a
                 promising drug target, Plasmodium falciparum lysyl tRNA
                 synthetase (PfKRS). Screening of this high-coverage library
                 with characterized PfKRS inhibitors revealed multiple
                 resistance-conferring substitutions including several
                 clinically relevant mutations. Genetic validation of these
                 mutations confirmed resistance of up to 100-fold and
                 computational modeling dissected their role in drug resistance.
                 We discuss potential applications of this data including the
                 potential to design compounds that can bypass the most serious
                 resistance mutations and future resistance surveillance.",

                 by its structure and function. This is how patterns of
                 evolutionary conservation in a multiple sequence alignment can
                 be exploited by algorithms like AlphaFold to predict structure
                 and other features. Human population sequencing offers the
                 potential to show similar trends within a single species.
                 However, although gene-level and domain-level aggregation of
                 variants is routinely applied, data still preclude simple
                 residue-level analysis per protein. Here, we aggregate
                 population variants within protein domain families to define
                 the missense enrichment score (MES) which captures population
                 constraint at positions in the family. Contrasting MES with
                 evolutionary conservation identifies positions that are key to
                 protein-ligand and protein-protein interaction specificity as
                 well as locations critical to folding, function and
                 pathogenicity. This approach also highlights a new class of
                 pathogenic variant hot spot at positions that are
                 evolutionarily conserved yet enriched in missense variants. We
                 found 5,086 positions in 766 domain families were missense
                 depleted (covering 365,300 residues in the human proteome) and
                 13,490 positions in 3,591 families were enriched in missense
                 variants (340,829 residues in human) and provide a map of
                 residue-level population constraint in human. Comparison to
                 61,214 three dimensional structures from the Protein Data
                 Bank, covering 40,394 sequences from 3,661 Pfam domains, and
                 over 10,000 variants labelled pathogenic in ClinVar provides
                 validation of these sites in context with structure and
                 pathogenicity. Application to the GPCR family identifies 17
                 sites important for ligand binding specificity as well as
                 sites key to function in all members of the GPCR family. For
                 nuclear receptor ligand binding domains, of 10 likely

                 affinities and kinetics for Spike receptor binding domain
                 through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 37Â°C. We discovered
                 variants that reduce and enhance binding, including three ACE2
                 variants that strongly inhibited (p.Glu37Lys,
                 $\Delta$$\Delta$G = -1.33 $\pm$ 0.15 kcal mol-1 and
                 p.Gly352Val, predicted $\Delta$$\Delta$G = -1.17 kcal mol-1)
                 or abolished (p.Asp355Asn) binding. We also identified two
                 variants with distinct population distributions that enhanced
                 affinity for Spike. ACE2 p.Ser19Pro ($\Delta$$\Delta$G = 0.59
                 $\pm$ 0.08 kcal mol-1) is predominant in the gnomAD African
                 cohort (AF = 0.003) whilst p.Lys26Arg ($\Delta$$\Delta$G =
                 0.26 $\pm$ 0.09 kcal mol-1) is predominant in the Ashkenazi
                 Jewish (AF = 0.01) and European non-Finnish (AF = 0.006)
                 cohorts. We compared ACE2 variant affinities to published
                 SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infectivity data and confirmed that ACE2
                 variants with reduced affinity for Spike can protect cells
                 from infection. The effect of variants with enhanced Spike
                 affinity remains unclear, but we propose a mechanism whereby
                 these alleles could cause greater viral spreading across
                 tissues and cell types, as is consistent with emerging
                 understanding regarding the interplay between receptor
                 affinity and cell-surface abundance. Finally, we compared
                 mCSM-PPI2 $\Delta$$\Delta$G predictions against our SPR data
                 to assess the utility of predictions in this system. We found
                 that predictions of decreased binding were well-correlated
                 with experiment and could be improved by calibration, but
                 disappointingly, predictions of highly enhanced binding were
                 unreliable. Recalibrated predictions for all possible ACE2
                 missense variants at the Spike interface were calculated and
                 used to estimate the overall burden of ACE2 variants on

                 gene essentiality and function. Accordingly, we interpret the
                 population variants in context with evolutionary constraint
                 and structural features including secondary structure,
                 accessibility and protein-protein interactions across 383

                 positions that are highly conserved across homologues and also
                 depleted in missense variants within the human population.
                 These positions are significantly enriched in intra-domain
                 contacts and so likely to be key for repeat packing. In

              that begins with the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
              glycoprotein (S-protein) and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme
              2 (ACE2). Genetic variability in ACE2 may be one factor that
              mediates the broad-spectrum severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
              COVID-19 outcomes. We investigated the capacity of ACE2 variation
              to influence SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on predicting the
              effect of missense variants on the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S-protein
              interaction. We validated the mCSM-PPI2 variant effect prediction
              algorithm with 26 published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV S-protein
              binding assays and found it performed well in this closely
              related system (True Positive Rate = 0.7, True Negative Rate =
              1). Application of mCSM-PPI2 to ACE2 missense variants from the
              Genome Aggregation Consortium Database (gnomAD) identified three
              that are predicted to strongly inhibit or abolish the S-protein
              ACE2 interaction altogether (p.Glu37Lys, p.Gly352Val and
              p.Asp355Asn) and one that is predicted to promote the interaction
              (p.Gly326Glu). The S-protein ACE2 inhibitory variants are
              expected to confer a high degree of resistance to SARS-CoV-2
              infection whilst the S-protein ACE2 affinity enhancing variant
              may lead to additional susceptibility and severity. We also
              performed in silico saturation mutagenesis of the S-protein ACE2
              interface and identified a further 38 potential missense
              mutations that could strongly inhibit binding and one more that
              is likely to enhance binding (Thr27Arg). A conservative estimate
              places the prevalence of the strongly protective variants between
              12-70 per 100,000 population but there is the possibility of
              higher prevalence in local populations or those underrepresented
              in gnomAD. The probable interplay between these ACE2 affinity

              power future genetic association studies of COVID-19 phenotypes

              mutant ACE2 with tailored S-protein affinity, which may be an
              improvement over a current recombinant ACE2 that is undergoing

                 $\alpha$-helical hairpin motifs stack to form superhelical,
                 often highly flexible structures. TPR domains occur in a wide
                 variety of proteins, and perform key functional roles
                 including protein folding, protein trafficking, cell cycle
                 control and post-translational modification. Here, we look at
                 the TPR domain of the enzyme O-linked GlcNAc-transferase
                 (OGT), which catalyses O-GlcNAcylation of a broad range of
                 substrate proteins. A number of single-point mutations in the
                 TPR domain of human OGT have been associated with the disease
                 Intellectual Disability (ID). By extended steered and
                 equilibrium atomistic simulations, we show that the OGT-TPR

                 ID-related local mutations substantially affect the global
                 dynamics of the TPR domain. Since the nanospring character of
                 the OGT-TPR domain is key to its function in binding and
                 releasing OGT substrates, these changes of its biomechanics
                 likely lead to defective substrate interaction. We find that
                 neutral mutations in the human population, selected by
                 analysis of the gnomAD database, do not incur these changes.
                 Our findings may not only help to explain the ID phenotype of
                 the mutants, but also aid the design of TPR proteins with

               of macromolecular structure data, contained in the Protein Data
               Bank (PDB). The goal of PDBe-KB is two-fold: (i) to increase the
               visibility and reduce the fragmentation of annotations
               contributed by specialist data resources, and to make these data
               more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) and
               (ii) to place macromolecular structure data in their biological
               context, thus facilitating their use by the broader scientific
               community in fundamental and applied research. Here, we describe
               the guidelines of this collaborative effort, the current status
               of contributed data, and the PDBe-KB infrastructure, which
               includes the data exchange format, the deposition system for
               added value annotations, the distributable database containing
               the assembled data, and programmatic access endpoints. We also
               describe a series of novel web-pages-the PDBe-KB aggregated
               views of structure data-which combine information on
               macromolecular structures from many PDB entries. We have
               recently released the first set of pages in this series, which
               provide an overview of available structural and functional
               information for a protein of interest, referenced by a UniProtKB

  abstract    = "SOX8 is an HMG-box transcription factor closely related to SRY
                 and SOX9. Deletion of the gene encoding Sox8 in mice causes
                 reproductive dysfunction but the role of SOX8 in humans is
                 unknown. Here, we show that SOX8 is expressed in the somatic
                 cells of the early developing gonad in the human and
                 influences human sex determination. We identified two
                 individuals with 46, XY disorders/differences in sex
                 development (DSD) and chromosomal rearrangements encompassing
                 the SOX8 locus and a third individual with 46, XY DSD and a
                 missense mutation in the HMG-box of SOX8. In vitro functional
                 assays indicate that this mutation alters the biological
                 activity of the protein. As an emerging body of evidence
                 suggests that DSDs and infertility can have common etiologies,
                 we also analysed SOX8 in a cohort of infertile men (n = 274)
                 and two independent cohorts of women with primary ovarian
                 insufficiency (POI; n = 153 and n = 104). SOX8 mutations were
                 found at increased frequency in oligozoospermic men (3.5\%; P
                 < 0.05) and POI (5.06\%; P = 4.5 $\times$ 10-5) as compared
                 with fertile/normospermic control populations (0.74\%). The
                 mutant proteins identified altered SOX8 biological activity as
                 compared with the wild-type protein. These data demonstrate
                 that SOX8 plays an important role in human reproduction and
                 SOX8 mutations contribute to a spectrum of phenotypes
                 including 46, XY DSD, male infertility and 46, XX POI.",

  abstract = "Human genome sequencing has generated population variant datasets
              containing millions of variants from hundreds of thousands of
              individuals[1][1]-[3][2]. The datasets show the genomic
              distribution of genetic variation to be influenced on genic and
              sub-genic scales by gene essentiality,[1][1],[4][3],[5][4]
              protein domain architecture[6][5] and the presence of genomic
              features such as splice donor/acceptor sites.[2][6] However, the
              variant data are still too sparse to provide a comparative
              picture of genetic variation between individual protein residues
              in the proteome.[1][1],[6][5] Here, we overcome this sparsity for
              â¼25,000 human protein domains in 1,291 domain families by
              aggregating variants over equivalent positions (columns) in
              multiple sequence alignments of sequence-similar (paralagous)
              domains[7][7],[8][8]. We then compare the resulting variation
              profiles from the human population to residue conservation across
              all species[9][9] and find that the same tertiary structural and
              functional pressures that affect amino acid conservation during
              domain evolution constrain missense variant distributions. Thus,
              depletion of missense variants at a position implies that it is
              structurally or functionally important. We find such positions
              are enriched in known disease-associated variants (OR = 2.83, p
              $\approx$ 0) while positions that are both missense depleted and
              evolutionary conserved are further enriched in disease-associated
              variants (OR = 1.85, p = 3.3$\times$10-17) compared to those that
              are only evolutionary conserved (OR = 1.29, p =
              4.5$\times$10-19). Unexpectedly, a subset of evolutionary
              Unconserved positions are Missense Depleted in human (UMD
              positions) and these are also enriched in pathogenic variants (OR
              = 1.74, p = 0.02). UMD positions are further differentiated from
              other unconserved residues in that they are enriched in ligand,
              DNA and protein binding interactions (OR = 1.59, p = 0.003),
              which suggests this stratification can identify functionally
              important positions. A different class of positions that are
              Conserved and Missense Enriched (CME) show an enrichment of
              ClinVar risk factor variants (OR = 2.27, p = 0.004). We
              illustrate these principles with the G-Protein Coupled Receptor
              (GPCR) family, Nuclear Receptor Ligand Binding Domain family and
              In Between Ring-Finger (IBR) domains and list a total of 343 UMD
              positions in 211 domain families. This study will have broad
              applications to: (a) providing focus for functional studies of
              specific proteins by mutagenesis; (b) refining pathogenicity
              prediction models; (c) highlighting which residue interactions to

                 indicate that the bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) display a
                 significant degree of conformational heterogeneity of their
                 peripheral substituents and the protein-induced nonplanar
                 skeletal deformations of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle. As
                 electronic properties of chromophores are altered by such
                 differences, a conformational effect may influence the
                 site-energies of specific pigments and thus play a role in
                 mediating the excitation energy transfer dynamics, but this
                 has not yet been established. The difficulty of assessing this
                 question is shown to be partly the result of the inability of
                 the sequential truncation approach usually employed to account
                 for interactions between the conformations of the macrocycle
                 and its substituents and an alternative approach is suggested.
                 By assigning the BChl atoms to meaningful atom groups and
                 performing all possible permutations of partial optimizations
                 in a full-factorial design, where each group is either frozen
                 in the crystal geometry or optimized in vacuo, followed by
                 excited state calculations on each resulting structure
                 (PM6//ZIndo/S), the specific effects of the conformations of
                 each BChl component as well as mutual interactions between the
                 molecular fragments on the site-energy can be delineated. This
                 factorial relaxation procedure gives different estimates of
                 the macrocycle conformational perturbation than the approach
                 of sequentially truncating the BChl periphery. The results
                 were evaluated in the context of published site-energies for
                 the FMO pigments from three species to identify how
                 conformational effects contribute to their distribution and
                 instances of cross-species conservation and functional
                 divergence of the BChl nonplanarity conformational

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Hereditary Fibrosing Poikiloderma (HFP) with
                 tendon contractures, myopathy and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP
                 [MIM 615704]) is a very recently described entity of syndromic
                 inherited poikiloderma. Previously by using whole exome
                 sequencing in five families, we identified the causative gene,
                 FAM111B (NM\_198947.3), the function of which is still
                 unknown. Our objective in this study was to better define the
                 specific features of POIKTMP through a larger series of
                 patients. METHODS: Clinical and molecular data of two families
                 and eight independent sporadic cases, including six new cases,
                 were collected. RESULTS: Key features consist of: (i)
                 early-onset poikiloderma, hypotrichosis and hypohidrosis; (ii)
                 multiple contractures, in particular triceps surae muscle
                 contractures; (iii) diffuse progressive muscular weakness;
                 (iv) pulmonary fibrosis in adulthood and (v) other features
                 including exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, liver impairment
                 and growth retardation. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging was
                 informative and showed muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration.
                 Histological examination of skeletal muscle revealed extensive
                 fibroadipose tissue infiltration. Microscopy of the skin
                 showed a scleroderma-like aspect with fibrosis and alterations
                 of the elastic network. FAM111B gene analysis identified five
                 different missense variants (two recurrent mutations were
                 found respectively in three and four independent families).
                 All the mutations were predicted to localize in the
                 trypsin-like cysteine/serine peptidase domain of the protein.
                 We suggest gain-of-function or dominant-negative mutations
                 resulting in FAM111B enzymatic activity changes. CONCLUSIONS:
                 HFP with tendon contractures, myopathy and pulmonary fibrosis,
                 is a multisystemic disorder due to autosomal dominant FAM111B
                 mutations. Future functional studies will help in
                 understanding the specific pathological process of this
                 fibrosing disorder.",

  abstract    = "Tetrapyrrole-containing proteins are one of the most
                 fundamental classes of enzymes in nature and it remains an
                 open question to give a chemical rationale for the multitude
                 of biological reactions that can be catalyzed by these
                 pigment-protein complexes. There are many fundamental
                 processes where the same (i.e., chemically identical)
                 porphyrin cofactor is involved in chemically quite distinct
                 reactions. For example, heme is the active cofactor for oxygen
                 transport and storage (hemoglobin, myoglobin) and for the
                 incorporation of molecular oxygen in organic substrates
                 (cytochrome P450). It is involved in the terminal oxidation
                 (cytochrome c oxidase) and the metabolism of H2O2 (catalases
                 and peroxidases) and catalyzes various electron transfer
                 reactions in cytochromes. Likewise, in photosynthesis the same
                 chlorophyll cofactor may function as a reaction center pigment
                 (charge separation) or as an accessory pigment (exciton
                 transfer) in light harvesting complexes (e.g., chlorophyll a).
                 Whilst differences in the apoprotein sequences alone cannot
                 explain the often drastic differences in physicochemical
                 properties encountered for the same cofactor in diverse
                 protein complexes, a critical factor for all biological
                 functions must be the close structural interplay between bound
                 cofactors and the respective apoprotein in addition to factors
                 such as hydrogen bonding or electronic effects. Here, we
                 explore how nature can use the same chemical molecule as a
                 cofactor for chemically distinct reactions using the concept
                 of conformational flexibility of tetrapyrroles. The
                 multifaceted roles of tetrapyrroles are discussed in the
                 context of the current knowledge on distorted porphyrins.
                 Contemporary analytical methods now allow a more quantitative
                 look at cofactors in protein complexes and the development of
                 the field is illustrated by case studies on hemeproteins and
                 photosynthetic complexes. Specific tetrapyrrole conformations
                 are now used to prepare bioengineered designer proteins with
                 specific catalytic or photochemical properties.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Severe dermatitis, multiple allergies, and
                 metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome is a recently recognized
                 syndrome caused by mutations in the desmoglein 1 gene (DSG1).
                 To date, only 3 families have been reported. OBJECTIVE: We
                 studied a new case of SAM syndrome known to have no mutations
                 in DSG1 to detail the clinical, histopathologic,
                 immunofluorescent, and ultrastructural phenotype and to
                 identify the underlying molecular mechanisms in this rare
                 genodermatosis. METHODS: Histopathologic, electron microscopy,
                 and immunofluorescent studies were performed. Whole-exome
                 sequencing data were interrogated for mutations in desmosomal
                 and other skin structural genes, followed by Sanger sequencing
                 of candidate genes in the patient and his parents. RESULTS: No
                 mutations were identified in DSG1; however, a novel de novo
                 heterozygous missense c.1757A>C mutation in the desmoplakin
                 gene (DSP) was identified in the patient, predicting the amino
                 acid substitution p.His586Pro in the desmoplakin polypeptide.
                 CONCLUSIONS: SAM syndrome can be caused by mutations in both
                 DSG1 and DSP. Knowledge of this genetic heterogeneity is
                 important for both analysis of patients and genetic counseling
                 of families. This condition and these observations reinforce
                 the importance of heritable skin barrier defects, in this case
                 desmosomal proteins, in the pathogenesis of atopic disease.",

                 about by apoprotein induced heme-macrocycle distortion. The

                 with the computationally inexpensive B3LYP/3-21g method
